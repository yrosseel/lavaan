\title{Observed Variable Correlation Matrix from a Model and Data}
\description{
The lavaan model syntax describes a latent variable model. Often, the user wants to see the covariance matrix generated by their model for diagnostic purposes.  However, their data may have far more columns of information than what is contained in their model.} 
\usage{
modelCov(model, data, na.rm=T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The model that will be fit by  lavaan.}
\item{data}{The data frame being used to fit the model.}
\item{na.rm}{logical.  Should missing values be removed?}
\item{...}{Other arguments to \code{\link{cov}}}
}
\details{
One must supply both a model, coded with proper \code{\link{model.syntax}} and a data frame from which a covariance matrix will be calculated.
